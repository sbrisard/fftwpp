"Create a :py:class:`Plan` for a complex-to-complex transform.\n"
"\n"
"Uses the so-called *advanced interface* that allows to compute multiple\n"
"transforms at a time. Refer to section 4.4, `Advanced Interface`_, in\n"
"the FFTW documentation, for more details.\n"
"\n"
"The input (``in``) and output (``out``) data arrays are stored in row-\n"
"major order. Both arrays are assumed to have the same shape. Transforms\n"
"are performed along the ``rank`` *first* axes of the arrays (the *last*\n"
"axes are merely iterated over).\n"
"\n"
"The ``sign`` parameter is used to ask for a forward (``sign == -1``,\n"
"default value) or backward (``sign == +1``) transform. Note that\n"
"backward transforms are *not normalized*.\n"
